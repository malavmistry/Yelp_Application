# Yelp_Application
I created an application that works similar to yelp application
In the application, users could search for business/attractions and their reviews.
The application dynamically filtered the results according to categories, attributes, demographics and open timings. 
I made the front-end of the application in NetBeans using Java.
For backend, I used Oracle 11g, and used SQL queries to create different tables and database.
Then, I parsed Json files for populating the database, using the yelp dataset available online. 
The technologies used are Net Beans, Java, Json, Oracle Database 11g, SQL, Swing.
